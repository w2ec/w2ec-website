This is the website for the Ward 2 Education Council (ward2edcouncil.org). 
The website was created with Mailchimp Websites, but Mailchimp does not allow you to connect a custom domain without paying $10/mo.
Therefore, I've copied the entire code from the Mailchimp site over to github which does let you host and connect a domain (for free!)
If we want to update this in the future, the easiest way probably is to make changes on Mailchimp Websites and then re-copy the relevant (or all) files.
